# OsO<sub>4</sub>

Parser for `.osm.pbf` files

## Name
This project started as an ambitious rewrite of [libosmium](https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium) (we will see about that ðŸ˜…).

So based on the somewhat common joke of "oxidizing projects" when rewriting them in rust,

this project's name is OsO<sub>4</sub> (i.e. Osmium tetroxide) an oxidized form of osmium.
